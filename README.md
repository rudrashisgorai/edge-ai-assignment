# edge-ai-assignment

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of parameter pruning and quantization techniques for deploying a digit classification convolutional neural network (CNN) onto resource-constrained edge devices. The project explores performance-efficiency tradeoffs by reducing the modelâ€™s size through pruning and quantization while maintaining high accuracy.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to deploy a digit classification model on an EFM32 microcontroller. The workflow is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Baseline Model Deployment
- **Training and Evaluation:**  
  The provided model was trained and evaluated in MATLAB, achieving an accuracy of **98.5%**.
- **Deployment:**  
  The baseline model was converted to C code using MATLAB Coder and deployed on the EFM32 board. Energy consumption was profiled over a 30+ second run, with the energy usage computed as:  


- **Memory Metrics:**  
- **RAM Usage:** 844 bytes  
- **Flash Usage:** 13,248 bytes

### Part 2: Pruned and Quantized Model Deployment
- **Model Pruning:**  
Both iterative and one-shot pruning methods were applied to the baseline model. The best pruned model (with a 90% prune ratio) achieved an accuracy of **94.8%**. Comparative plots were generated:
- Original vs. pruned accuracies vs. prune ratio.
- Pruned channels per layer vs. output channels per layer.
- **Deployment of Pruned Model:**  
The pruned model was deployed on the EFM32 board with energy usage measured at:  


- **Quantization:**  
The best pruned model was further quantized to 8-bit precision, reaching an accuracy of **94.3%** while further reducing memory requirements.
